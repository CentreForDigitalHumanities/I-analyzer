j^^^ A onsistency, said John ' M ~""~ VCleese, ""is the Si consolation of the » ' mediocre. I know per - ^ 1 ^_ V fectly well I will say ^*^ different things on different days depending on what's circulating in my mind."" Right All Cleese quotes in the following piece were emitted from the circulating Geese cerebellum one morning in Holland Park in the basement of a shop which he uses as an office. They may bear no relation to quotes emitted at any other time or place. They will certainly bear no relation to remarks Cleese has made else* where to the effect that, one, he is leaving show business, two, he is going back to teaching and, three, he isn't funny any more. On the morning in question, the theme was The Cleese Future. ""Af 48,1 have the very distinct sense that the amount of time I've got left is limited,"" he said, one unnaturally long leg propped on a radiator and one hand toying with a packet of cigarettes. ""You don't think of this in your twenties and not much in your thirties. But if you've only got about 20 active years left and there's a lot you're interested in, then things you're not very interested in simply get sidelined."" : So whit is the big interest?
""What it really comes down to is almost anything about the way our minds, work. I'm about 30 per cent of the way into my second book with the psychiatrist Robin' Skinner. It's not really a continu - ation of the first, it's a separate body ,of ideas that takes the research that's been done on exceptionally healthy families and applies those principles to the way ^ tha^rompanieswork ."" , ulUh , , , (heese developed an'interest in psycho-analysis whenlie subjected .himself to it during- the* break-up "" of his first marriage, to the actress and co-writer of Fawlty Towers, Connie Booth. He became in - terested in business when he setup the company Video Arts 15 years ago as a way of financially insulating himself from the va - garies of the entertainment in - d ustry . ^ VA produces funny training films signalling the cock - ups that can occur at work. Many found it an odd role for the key figure in Monty Python's Flying Circus, the folk herd of a million adolescent polytechnic anarchists who imitated his funny walks and his cold, psychopathically cruel voice. ""A lot of the Python team had the kind of left-wing views in
which business was regarded as a negative activity. People think in a rather confused way. I was never against business but I was against certain ways of carrying on busi - ness . The main thing is people's attitudes to authority. I always felt that authority was not necessarily a bad thing. I now think it can be an absolutely excellent thing. I'm interested in making fun of authority that's exercised badly."" Cleese may be the creator of the :dead parrot sketch and of Basil Fawlty, but he is also the son of a Weston-Super-Mare insurance salesman. It is a background that left him with plenty of petit - bourgeois prudence. He has discovered that it also left him inhibited when it came to looking after Number One. His father could never dp anything simply for his own enjoyment He would take his son to football matches but never go on his own. It was a characteristic which Geese was to [discover, on self-analysis , that he ;had inherited. ""I think I was one of those people who didn't have the self - confidence to know deep down what it was that I wanted to do. So I did things in order to be approved by other people. There's a lot of us around. But now rm en - gaged in a kind of struggle to find out what it is I really want to do in the last :20 years and ;that's ;yery good. It's a very nice place to be>. I've solved most of the financial problems, so I can write a book about anything that interests me even if nobody gives me a commission.""
-wp"" w'is work practices, g M however, mean that Mnimij Cleese cannot W B lightly commit him - "" 'u bL :;' m self to anything.-He ""^^ ' is frighteningly conscientious. -"" Each episode of Fawlty Towcts took four months to write and went through"" 10 drafts. He would tell his friends during the process that the first version was good enough for a Thames Television sitcom, the second for Granada, and so on until he finally arrived at some - thing good enough for BBC2 and better than any sitcom. And it was only a few months ago that he said to fellow comic and writer Ste - pheh . Fry that he considered that, /Jon 'the whole, he had finally mastered the form of the sketch. Fry, still relatively new to the game, was speechless. The latest project is a feature film, for release next year, entitled A Fish Called Wanda. It involves, among others, Maria Aitken and
.- '• Sonnet- Python; Michael Pann. Qeese plays a barrister defending a gang of jewel thieves. The script went through only four drafts — three written at Champney's Health Farm at Tring and one at Holland Park. In addition, Cleese frequently appears in television commercials — at one point the _ industry considered an award for The Best Use of John Geese. In Britain he is selective about these jobs; less so in Australia. ?Tm less fussy there. I go by Australian standards rather than British. Fve done commercials in Australia I would pay for you not to see—pretzels , fish fingers... "" He has written an hour-long television piece on romantic love for which there are as yet no production plans. He claims to have ""suffered at the hands of love a great deal,"" and concludes: ""I don't think it leads to happiness. If I made a speech about that, I don't think it would have any effect — but an hour's television might change people's attitudes."" The bringing of enlightenment is now the rationale behind every - thing he does. Psycho-analysis has bitten him like some acutely introspective and yet proselytizing religion. He has the enthusiasm of a convert, accompanied by the irritating air of somebody who thinks he knows something that you don't ""People try to change the world instead of themselves. Once I've understood something, I take great pleasure in wanting to hand it on. I think the great mistake most people make is the assump - tion that most people are sane. I know very few people who are sane and I think I've only known one man in my life who was really grown-up . He was an English Lord in the United States — Lord Pentland (who headed a founda - tion named after the esoteric thinker Gurdjieff). All the other people Tve met are terribly rec -
ognizable as kids who have learnt ' so-called grown-up ways , of behaving. "" Geese still visits a psychiatrist occasionally, though it does not seem to be too serious. At one recent session they had a good laugh, and as he was leaving the shrink asked: ""Oh , by the way, how are you?"" But he sticks to the techniques he has learnt He used to suffer from what he took to be a sort of permanent mild 'flu . Later he realized he was actually making himself ill in order to rest Now, if he feels a sore throat coming on, Jie simply lies down for three hours. In fact he has raised resting to a fine art He plans his diary months ahead, leaving large R and R — rest and recreation — gaps. Agents and friends know these to be inviolable. V et, amidst all this formidable organization, he still aspires to a sort of limbo of languid in - . competence — ""I 'm thinking of forming a lunch club called BLOCH - the British League of the Completely Hope - less . To join you have to take an oath saying: 'I now, realize I am completely hopeless.' My main problem is I have to spend time with people who have not realized it."" All those contradictions, the faintly smug air, and the implicit disclaimer that comes with every quote, leave one with the sensa - tion that conversation is telling you less rather than more about the man. Seeking further enlightenment, I joined him at a party in a West End hotel to celebrate the 15th birthday of Video Arts. In one corner of the room, Stephen Fry was explaining how he had spent his Cambridge years' listening to comedy records rattier than pop music and how, to him, Geese had simply been God. Geese regards Fry as the new -
generation a siyie like his own. And it was'Fry who did the Third Secret Policeman's Ball sketch which involved the - ritual humiliation of Geese via remarks about his ""messy divorce"" and the pathetic failure of Fawlty Towers after only two series. Geese crawled off the stage in tears. Elsewhere at the party Prunella Scales, creator of the deathless Sybil Fawlty, looked alarmed and reached for her showbusiness thesaurus to say he was ""wonderful"". Geese, resplendent and faintly terrifying with his chest covered by several acres of yellow sweater, was being a per - fectly adjusted host and just as inscrutably affable as he had been at Holland Park. Once psycho-analysis persuades 'you that you know what you're like, you become impossible. You discuss yourself with happy, irres - ponsible enthusiasm. You de - velop the concerned stare of the social worker, designed to estab - lish that whoever you are talking to is either completely mad or terminally repressed. And you embrace your own flaws, such as inconsistency, happily imagining them to be lovable. Cleese is not quite there yet, but a perilous glibness has began to intrude. Tm interested in the little insanities,"" he is saying. 'Tm talking about if you really start to examine yourself, it is a bit startling what makes you tick. Most of us go around with highly sanitized images of ourselves — highly complimentary ones. But insight changes us without an act of will. I get about three insights about myself a day. I aee what a complete s - - -1 am now. It's very liberating ."" Of course, being neither medio - cre nor consistent tomorrow he may think differently. The worry is that he may not ' © Times Nowspapora Ltd, 1987

His big success story is Compaq Computers, as ad - vertised on television by John Cleese, Seeing a gap in the market, Rosen put $2 million into the company when it was little more than an idea on the back of an envelope , shrugged off the sceptics, took on IBM — and won. Compaq Comput - ers is now worth $100 million and Rosen is laughing all the way to the bank. Venturers (BBC2,8.20pm), the first of a three-part series by Will Hutton, is a celebration of these supermen who can, seemingly, realize the alchemist's classic dream of turning base metal into gold. It can all end in tears, when the company fails to do its stuff, but it is the managers who get the comeuppance, not the backers. Harry Fitzgibbon, a Harvard man who used to run counter-insurgency opera - tions in Central America, is a
disciple of Rosen who is fast emulating his mentor. He is another with the golden touch , building companies from nothing and watching the billions clock up. Showing that he also has an artistic side by helicoptering off to Glyndebourne, he denies he is ruthless. ""It's a humane busi - ness , because you are dealing with people"". Perhaps he will be less humane, now that the stock market crash has wiped
two-thirds oif the value of his shares, The making and losing of fortunes has a fascination even to those of us whose only dabbling in venture capital is a few shares in British Telecom, I only wish the programme had been more critical and stronger on explanation. Will Hutton's breathless, slangy, jargon-filled commentary is not an aid to understanding.

Could the season of goodwill be bad for your health and happiness? Liz Gill reports
Our rosy-hued dream of Christmas may in reality turn out to resemble Dante rather than Dickens: families can make the festivities hell. We cling to the belief that the , only way to spend the season is with three generations gatheredt beside the hearth. The solitary are to be pitied and where possible rescued Nobody must be alone. Yet at its worst, Christmas with one's nearest and dearest can be the catalyst for all kinds of extreme behaviour , from domes - tic violence to drug and alcohol abuse . More commonly its strains will trigger such stress-related symptoms as migraines and stom - ach aches. Even the most placid families seem hard-pressed to get through it all without some sort of upset . . The problem, according to Dr Robin Skynner , a psychiatrist, is the gap between expectation and actuality . ""Christmas stirs up all our deepest longings to have a happy family. We have fantasies about the perfect family we should have, and of course all the build - up and the publicity images add to these feelings .
""We also expect to be able to feel very positive towards each other. We will be happier, fr iend - lier , more tolerant. Of course this is fine up to a point, but if one's expectations of oneself and others are too great then there can be disaster, because most families have their imperfections. It's like expecting an absolutely amazing present: when you only get a very good one you're inevitably disappointed."" Skynner believes our modern age is particularly prey to fantasy. ""When people went to church more, they were given the other side . The view was that one couldn't expect life to be wonder - ful all the time. We have tended to change towards unrealistic expectations . ""Another common problem is where parents have suffered a disappointment when they were
small and they want to make it up to their children. So they try too hard, and then feel resentful because the children aren't grate - ful enough or happy enough or they get bored, like all kids do. Often it's better for the parents to make sure that they have a good time themselves and not to be too self-sacrificing . ""There are classic Christmas perils: the uncle who always gets too sloshed , the prodigal who returns and promises to turn over a new leaf , the simmering sibling rivalry. Christmas intensifies everything. And it starts earlier and lasts longer. A lot of things work for a short time, but Christ - mas is a bit like marriage: it goes on for longer than you can keep things under the carpet"" His advice is to take it easy, enjoy the food and presents and what they're worth, be able to escape temporarily without feeling guilty (a walk, a nap , any kind of breather) — and to play games.
""I know we hate them. I always resist but I'm always glad I've been made to play. They release the tension, they're a healthy outlet After all games allow you to have these evil feelings about your family ."" Mrs Judy Hildebrand , a consu l - tant at the Institute of Family Therapy, frequently gets ""panic station"" signals from clients in the run-up to Christmas. ""It generates an incredible amount of tension. Existing difficulties are exas - perated , problems that have been shelved often come up again. People become frantic. They say 'You must tell me what to do. I must sort it out for Christmas'. For instance, in one family there was the big question of whether the child deserved the present in view of his considerable misdemeanours . But of course that is only the tip of what is going on."" Family therapy deals with the individual's problems in the con - text of the family. The theory, she says, is that one member's distress will affect everyone else. Thus although it may be problems such
as drug abuse , aggression or truancy that prompt an individual referral , therapists like Hildebrand try to work with the whole family wherever possible. The family may unwittingly have contributed to the problem or may un - consciously be maintaining it, but Hildebrand stresses that the sys - tem apportions no blame. She would like to see a toning down of Christmas hype, particularly on television. ""It projects such an artificial and tinselly picture, which can be very painful if you are not part of a warm, loving, close-knit , finan - cially secure family. They say they
balance this by showing pro - grammes about down-and-outs , but there are a heck of a lot of fam - i lies in between."" Dr Judith Trowell, a child psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic in London , deals with a wide range of disturbed behaviour including physical violence, delin - q uenc y , depression , solvent abuse and running away from home. She says the disturbed person may be acting as a sort of lightning conductor for much wider family storms. ""Family therapy means you don't take the problem at face value but look at the wider context. The difficulties may be
coming from another member of the group or the group as a whole."" She finds the immediate pre - Christmas period a time when trouble flares. ""These incidents would probably happen anyway, but Christmas is particularly a time for them to come to a head."" Trowell believes that she sees the extreme end of something which affects most families to some extent ""Even something as com - mon as grandparents being over - in dulgent with too many gifts or sweets can provoke a clash , or make the parents very up-tight because their house rules are being broken. Coping with Christmas
takes a considerable degree . of calmness and maturity. Some - times it's a help to have an outsider, a neighbour or a friend in the group. It lightens things. We all tend to behave better with strangers ."" The Samaritans run a full ser - vice over the Christmas period and the number of calls does not diminish. Simon Armson, exter - na l relations officer, says : ""You can feel isolated in a family crowd. And a lot of jollity, or what app - ears to be everyone else's conviv - iality , can make you feel worse. ""People can find themselves thrown together in an extended family in a way they're not used to, and the stresses that generates can be hard to handle. You are required to relate to people you may have some link with but who you don't feel particularly close to, and that's very demanding if things are. not good for you. Christmas is such a big deal it focuses on weak spots.""
Where families already have particular problems — unemploy - ment , financial troubles , drug addiction or alcoholism — Christ - mas can be the spark that lights the fuse .
J ames Ditzler, a psycholo - gist who runs a residential treatment centre, says that social drinking gives the alcoholic an extra excuse at Christmas. ""It 's accept - able to get plastered at this time of year. The atmosphere affects the drug user, too, who says 'Look , everyone is getting high on what they want, why shouldn't I?' Addicts tend to be idealists and so they feel guilty about what they're doing and use that as further rationalization to keep drinking."" But he says that Christmas is also frequently the time when families draw the line and force the addict to seek help. ""They remember what happened on previous years and they see it all building up again ."" The Marriage Guidance Coun - cil sees a substantial increase in the numbers of people seeking help after the holiday. In some areas it is up by 50 per cent ""It can be a crisis time for some families,"" Zelda West-Meads , its spokes - woman , says . ""The holiday lasts a long time nowadays, maybe as long as 10 days , with New Year. Families are flung together , often three generations under the same roof who all want very different things, at a time of year
you're likely to be stuck indoors. It can be very claustrophobic."" The situation is worse when families have tried to avoid facing their problems during the year by throwing themselves into their work or hobbies. ""They 've spent very little time together, and then at Christmas they 're all together for a long time, drink loosens people's tongues and one thing leads to another."" Parties, with all their opportunities for intrigue and jealousy, can be another battle ground. This ""pressure-cooker"" effect can lead, West-Meads says, to physical and emotional violence — "" plus all those stress related things like sleeplessness, headaches, tummy aches and so on."" Women may come under particular strain because they tend still to shoulder most of the social burden and may find their loyal - ties torn in different directions — as mother, wife and daughter. ""They load themselves up and they feel martyred."" The secret of a reasonably calm Christmas is, she says, planning and negotiation, right down to who watches what on the tele - vis ion — a common source of
upset, in the councils experience. ""It 's no good trying to force teenagers to spend every minute with granny just because she's come to stay. She'd probably appreciate a bit of peace and quiet anyway, and then enjoy the time they do want to spend with her. ""It 's a good idea to take a break as a couple, to get away for a while; and you also have to talk about things before they get to explosion point. Tell your partner that your mother might make you tetchy. The trouble is most of us save it all up until we can't stand it any more and that's when feelings are hurt."" Even with all its potential for horrors, the family group is still probably the best way to spend the festive season. West-Meads points out that the recently bereaved or divorced feel their loss most poignantly at'this time of year , as do grandparents separated from their grandchildren by a marriage breakdown.
And Skynner, who with John Cleese wrote Families and How to Survive Them, points out that Christmas scores only 12 out of a possible 100 on the stress scale. Only minor violations of the law rank lower. ""So we shouldn't worry about it too much. The secret is to enjoy what you've got"" © Times Newspapers Ltd 1987
