3088886	5	8	65	Ceisteanna &ndash Questions. - Official Engagements.	2000-01-26	Mr. Bertie Ahern	Fianna Fáil	Dublin (Finglas)	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together. As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the Dáil on Wednesday 15 December, I attended the European Council in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December. The agenda for the meeting was ambitious and a number of potentially contentious issues were discussed. I am pleased that progress was made on all of these matters. In relation to enlargement, the European Council decided that the accession negotiation process should now include all 12 accession countries on an equal footing, each to be judged on its own merits. The Council also confirmed that the Union should be in a position to welcome new member states from end 2002. In addition, we successfully found a formula to include Turkey as a candidate country, while recognising the necessity for all candidates to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria before entering negotiations. The meeting also discussed the forthcoming intergovernmental conference. It was agreed that it should be convened in early February and conclude by the end of this year. It is likely to convene on 14 February. The agenda will focus primarily on the three Amsterdam leftovers: size and composition of the commission the weighting of votes in the Council the possible extension of qualified majority voting as well as a small number of related institutional changes. Other items may come on the agenda as negotiations proceed. Following from the Cologne European Council, an issue of key interest to Ireland at the summit was the common European policy on security and defence. The report by the Presidency on this issue rightly made clear that the EU's engagement relates to Petersberg Tasks and not to the [4] so-called Article 5 issues of mutual defence. It was also important for us that the EU at the highest level be seen to support the United Nations and recognise the primary role of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. At my request the conclusions reflect that fundamental point. Two main areas were addressed from Ireland's point of view, capabilities and decision making structures. In essence, as to capabilities it was agreed that member states would be able by 2003 to deploy a force of between 50,000 and 60,000 capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks. I should stress that participation by any member state will be on a case by case basis as individual missions arise. I also emphasise that what is involved is not a standing European army and the conclusions from the Council explicitly recognise that this is the case. My first visit abroad this year was an official visit to Lesotho on 10 January, followed by an official visit to South Africa from 11 to 14 January. In Lesotho, I met Prime Minister Mosisili who was accompanied by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Education and Natural Resources. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation for Ireland's development assistance to his country during the past 25 years. We had a discussion on important regional issues and I took the opportunity to highlight Ireland's campaign for the Security Council. He assured me of his commitment to political reforms and the strengthening of democratic institutions within Lesotho. I also made a courtesy call on King Letsie III. I was happy to perform the official opening of the new offices of the Consulate of Ireland in Maseru, where I had the opportunity to meet political figures from Lesotho, religious leaders, members of the Irish community, particularly those working on development projects, and members of the international development aid community. I travelled with several members of the Lesotho Cabinet to visit remote areas of the country where Ireland Aid has been working to improve the lives of the people in very fundamental ways. I visited projects which are developing the social and economic infrastructure of the country and providing drinking water, education and health care facilities. In South Africa, I met President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy President Jacob Zuma. Discussions focused on: the experience of South Africa since the end of the apartheid era in 1994 and the current programme of economic and social transition the Northern Ireland peace process – I expressed my thanks for the role played by South Africa in supporting its progress in so many ways Ireland's economic performance and potential for the further development of bilateral trade the EU-South Africa Trade Agreement and regional African issues. I received thanks for Ireland's support for the anti-apartheid movement and for Ireland's ongoing development co-operation assistance. [5] On my visit to South Africa I was accompanied by a 20 member business delegation and I was happy to meet their South African business partners and to explore with them possibilities for developing trade, investment and partnerships between the two countries. At an Enterprise Ireland business breakfast in Johannesburg I addressed 150 business people on the subject of Ireland's economic performance and the development of economic relations between Ireland and South Africa. In both Johannesburg and Capetown I visited development co-operation projects which are supported by Ireland Aid, mainly in the area of justice, reconciliation and support for at-risk groups. I was struck by the enormity of the problem posed by the HIV virus and AIDS, not only in the countries I visited but, as was pointed out to me, all over Africa. Ireland Aid is already supporting a number of projects in this area. I welcome the launch yesterday of an Ireland Aid strategy on HIV/AIDS. This is aimed at increasing and making more coherent Ireland Aid's support for programmes to prevent and treat the disease. The strategy also addresses its socio-economic consequences for communities in poor countries where the incidence may be as high as 50% or more. I will remain in close contact with the European Commission and other member states regarding the EU's development aid programmes and their contribution to alleviating the problem of HIV/AIDS. I addressed the South African Institute of International Affairs on the Northern Ireland peace process. I visited Robben Island prison in the company of Mr. Ahmed Kathrada who was imprisoned there with Nelson Mandela. The conditions during their time were very difficult but Mr. Kathrada told me that they drew inspiration from the support they received from around the world, including support from Ireland. I also met members of the Irish community in South Africa in both Pretoria and Capetown. With regard to my EU and international related programme until the end of June, I plan to visit Australia and the United States from 9 to 18 March. Preparations for this visit are being finalised at present. I will also attend the special European Council on employment in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March. In addition, it seems likely that the EU/Africa Summit planned for Cairo in early April will proceed. The final European Council of the Portuguese Presidency will be held on 19 and 20 June. I will also attend EXPO in Hanover on 28 June, the day set aside as Ireland's national day. I have made a number of visits to accession countries and will make further such visits as the opportunity arises. The details of the strategic focus for the development of this country's interests and image at international level are outlined in my Department's strategy statement. In particular, the business plan for the European and international affairs division contains the goals, outputs and specific actions which are employed to achieve [6] this focus. The programme of international meetings which I have undertaken provides a tangible focus to this strategy. The decision to visit a particular country or meet with its representatives is taken in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the first instance, having considered our bilateral interests. Such interests include political, economic, cultural and development co-operation. The European and international affairs division is responsible for the implementation of the strategy. I wrote to European Commission President Prodi on 22 November enclosing a copy of the national development plan. He replied on 3 January wishing the Government success with the implementation of the plan. I have had no contact with the Acting President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin, since his appointment at the end of last year.
