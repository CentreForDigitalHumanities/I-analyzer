### About DBNL

The Digital Library of Dutch Literature ([DBNL](https://www.dbnl.org/)) is a digital collection of texts from Dutch literature, linguistics, and cultural history, from the earliest period to the present. The collection represents the whole of the Dutch language area. DBNL is a collaboration between the [Taalunie](https://taalunie.org/), the [Vlaamse Erfgoedbibliotheken](https://vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheken.be/), and the [KB, the Dutch Royal Library](https://www.kb.nl/).

### What can you find in the DBNL dataset?

The DBNL dataset can be used for research into Dutch and Flemish linguistics and literature, from the middle ages to the present. Limburghish, Frisian, Surinam, and South African literature are represented.

The dataset contains digitised texts, which have been manually corrected, with metadata. It includes medieval literature as well as classic novels. In addition, the dataset contains magazines from Dutch language and literary studies, such as De Gids and De Revisor.

### Availability

The I-analyzer corpus contains the publicly available portion of the [DBNL-dataset](https://www.kb.nl/onderzoeken-vinden/datasets/dbnl-dataset). These texts are in the public domain. (You can also download the full dataset through this link.)

For some books, the public dataset provides metadata but not the full text. In documents with metadata only, the full text is usually available on the DBNL interface.
