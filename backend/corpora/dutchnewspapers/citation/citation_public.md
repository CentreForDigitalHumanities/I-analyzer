If you cite this corpus, we recommend the following format.

## Citing the whole corpus

To cite the entire corpus, follow citation guidelines for databases or datasets.

The [Delpher corpus](https://www.delpher.nl/) is developed by the KB (Dutch Royal Library). Your citation should attribute the archive the KB, but also make it clear that you used the version published on {{ site_name }}.

### APA style

> KB, Nationale Biliotheek (2018). *Delpher* [data set]. {{ site_name }}. {{ frontend_url }}/search/dutchnewspapers-public

### MLA style

[MLA guidelines](https://style.mla.org/) recommend against citing a database, and recommend [citing each individual work you use](https://style.mla.org/separate-entries-database-works/). If you want to cite the entire corpus nonetheless, we recommend the following format:

> KB, Nationale Bibliotheek. "Delpher". *{{ site_name }}*, 2018, {{ frontend_url }}/search/dutchnewspapers-public

## Citing a single article

To cite a single article, follow citation guidelines for newspaper articles. You can provide the URL to the article on {{ site_name }} in your citation.

Most articles on {{ site_name }} also include the URL of the article on Delper (this starts with `http://resolver.kb.nl`). These URLs are specifically created to be a stable reference point, so you may prefer to us that link instead.

### APA style

> Beurs- en Marktberigten (1851, January 30). *Rotterdamsche Courant*, 13. {{ frontend_url }}/document/dutchnewspapers-public/ddd:010979847:mpeg21:a0010
