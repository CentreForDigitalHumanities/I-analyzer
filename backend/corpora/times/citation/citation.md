### MLA style

[MLA guidelines](https://style.mla.org/) recommend against citing a database, and recommend [citing each individual work you use](https://style.mla.org/separate-entries-database-works/). If you want to cite the entire corpus nonetheless, we recommend the following format:

> Gale. "The Times Digital Archive". *I-analyzer*, 2017, {{ frontend_url }}/search/times

## Citing a single article

To cite a single article, follow citation guidelines for newspaper articles.

You can reference I-analyzer in your citation, though some citation guidelines recommend against this. (The Times corpus on I-analyzer is not publicly accessible, and newspaper articles can be accessed through other archives.)

If you do reference I-analyzer, you can use the unique link of the article as the URL.
