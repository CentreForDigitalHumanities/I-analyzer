*Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO)* is a fully text-searchable corpus of books, pamphlets and broadsides in all subjects printed between 1701 and 1800. It currently contains over 135,000 titles amounting to over 26 million fully searchable pages. *ECCO* is a digitization of the eighteenth-century section of the works catalogued in the *English Short-title Catalogue (ESTC)*.

Most of these works were printed in England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States, but it also contains works printed in territories under British colonial rule as well as from countries across Europe and Asia.
