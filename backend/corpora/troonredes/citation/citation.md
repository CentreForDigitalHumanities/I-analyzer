## Referencing the dataset

To cite the entire corpus, follow citation guidelines for databases.

We recommend that the collection of transcripts and metadata is attributed to [troonredes.nl](http://troonredes.nl). However, you citation should include that you consulted the version published on {{ site_name }}.

Note that this references does *not* cover the word models trained on the corpus. See below for recommendations on how to cite the models.

See also [database information in references (APA)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/database-information).

### MLA style

[MLA guidelines](https://style.mla.org/) recommend against citing a database, and recommend [citing each individual work you use](https://style.mla.org/separate-entries-database-works/). If you want to cite the entire corpus nonetheless, we recommend the following format:

> Redactieteam troonredes.nl. "Troonredes". *{{ site_name }}*, 2024, {{ frontend_url }}/search/troonredes

## Referencing a single speech

To cite a specific speech, follow citation guidelines for orations, and clarify that you used the transcript provided on {{ site_name }}. We provide examples for a speech below.

### APA style

### Other citation styles

Some style guides recommend that a citation of a speech should include both the date and location. The location was not always the same, and is not listed on {{ site_name }}.
