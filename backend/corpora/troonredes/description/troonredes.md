Troonredes (throne speeches) are the speeches from the throne that formally mark the opening of the parliamentary year, known in the Netherlands as “Prinsjesdag”, taking place on the third Tuesday of September each year. During a joint session of the Dutch senate and the house of representatives, the queen or king reads a speech that has been prepared by the Dutch government which outlines the state of affairs and plans for the coming parliamentary year. This corpus contains the “troonredes” from 1814 until 2018, as well as some inaugural addresses, which are speeches given during coronation.

Missing years: in 1940-1944 no speech was written.

The transcripts are provided by [troonredes.nl](troonredes.nl).
