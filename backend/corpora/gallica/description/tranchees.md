This corpus contains journals spread in the trenches of the French military during World War 1. These journals were written and disseminated by soldiers for their comrades.

Many of these journals only published a few issues; others continued after the war, such as *Crapouillot* and *Canard enchaîné*. Some journals were printed, while others were copied using makeshift methods. Printed journals would end up in the legal deposit, but public knowledge of these makeshift, "ephemeral" journals could be incomplete, as it dependended on donations.

The various journals were digitised and made publicly available by [Gallica](https://gallica.bng.fr); these journals are part of Gallica's [Journaux de tranchées collection](https://gallica.bnf.fr/selections/fr/html/journaux-de-tranchees).

Only journals which were findable through the overview of the collection "Journaux de Tranchees" on Gallica were added, and only if they had plain text available.
