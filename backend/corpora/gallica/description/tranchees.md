This corpus contains journals spread in the trenches of the French military during World War 1.

The various sources were digitised and made publicly available by [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/selections/fr/html/presse-et-revues/journaux-de-tranchees)

Note that only those journals which were findable through the overview of the collection "Journaux de Tranchees" on Gallica were added, and only if they had plain text available.
