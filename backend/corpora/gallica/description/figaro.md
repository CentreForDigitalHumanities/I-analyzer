This corpus contains digitised issues from *Le Figaro*, a French national newspaper.

Starting out as a satirical journal in 1826, *Le Figaro* was revived with weekly publications in 1854 (the start of this collection), and become a daily paper in 1866. Publications temporarily ceased during World War II, to avoid submitting to censorship. While *Le Figaro* remains a major French newspaper to this day, this collection contains publications until 1954, due to copyright.
