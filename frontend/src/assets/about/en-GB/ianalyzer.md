## What is Textcavator?

Textcavator is a tool for exploring corpora (large collections of texts). You can use Textcavator to find relevant documents, or to make visualisations to understand broader trends in the corpus. The interface is designed to be accessible for users of all skill levels.

Textcavator is primarily intended for academic research and higher education. We focus on data that is relevant for the humanities, but we are open to datasets that are relevant for other fields.

## Development

Textcavator is developed at Utrecht University's Centre for Digital Humanities by the Research Software Lab. Searching through text data is the first step for a lot of humanities research, and Textcavator is our way of adressing similar needs from researchers.

Textcavator evolved from xTAS, developed at the University of Amsterdam. This led to the development of [Texcavator](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/texcavator) by Utrecht University, the Netherlands eScience Centre, and the University of Amsterdam. Since 2015, the Research Software Lab has continued to develop the software. From 2017-2025, we used the name I-analyzer, now Textcavator.

Textcavator is designed as a flexible application that can serve a variety of research projects. The application is not tied to a specific dataset, and easily extended with new corpora. There is also an environment for researchers to create and manage their own corpora, currently in an experimental phase.

We have worked with different research projects over time to add corpora and develop the application. You can find more information about some of these projects in our [portfolio](https://cdh.uu.nl/portfolio/).

Textcavator is developed as open source software. The [source code of Textcavator](https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities/I-analyzer) is shared with an MIT licence.

## Can I add my data to Textcavator?

We are always interested in helping researchers by adding new text corpora! If you have some data that you want to add, get in touch and we will discuss the possibilities.

However, be aware that not all data is suitable to be added to Textcavator. We may have to decline adding your data if...

- Your data is not available in a machine-friendly format. Machine-friendly formats include an archive of CSV, XML or JSON files, or an API. Machine-unfriendly formats include an archive of PDF files, scanned images that have not been processed into text, or a web interface without an API.
- Your data contains sensitive information, such as personal data or copyrighted material that cannot be shared with other researchers.
- Your data cannot be structured into small documents for handy searching.
- Adding your data would require a significant time investment on our behalf, and you do not have available funds or an affiliation with the humanities faculty of Utrecht University.
- Your data does not contain natural language.
- Your purpose with the data is not academic research or education, and the data does not have broader academic value.

Do you think that some of these may apply to you? We are still interested in hearing from you! There may be solutions to these issues; just be aware that Textcavator may not be the tool you are looking for.
