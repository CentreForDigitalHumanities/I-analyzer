This page describes some terms that you may find on Textcavator. If you are not sure what a term means, this is the place to look!

## Corpus / corpora

A corpus is a collection of texts. The plural of corpus is corpora.

The data on Textcavator is divided in corpora. A corpus usually has a clear focus: a location, time period, publication, etc.

## CSV

CSV stands for *comma-separated values*. This is a data format for files. When you download data from Textcavator, you will receive a CSV file.

You can open CSV files in spreadsheet editors like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc. They are also well-suited for scripting languages like Python or R. See [downloading data](/manual/download#using-csv-files) for more information.

## Document

On Textcavator, each corpus is a collection of *documents*. A document is essentially the "unit" of the data. What makes a document, depends on the kind of data. In a newspaper archive, each document might be a single article, while in a corpus of parliamentary debates, each document could be a single speech.

## Named entity

A text can contain named entities: people, locations, organisations, etc. that the text refers to by name. For example, "René Descartes", "Paris", or "Utrecht University". In some corpora, you can view and search for named entities. See [viewing named entities](/manual/namedentities) for more information.

## Open source

We call software open source when the source code is freely available. That means anyone can view it, share it with others, or edit it to make their own version. There may still be conditions for re-using the software, such as including an attribution to the original author.

Textcavator is open source.

## Public domain

A work is in the public domain if it is not protected by copyright. That means anyone is free to share or build on the work, with no restrictions.

The most common reason why works are in the public domain, is that they are old, so any copyright has expired. However, a creator can also "dedicate" a work to the public domain.

## Query

When you provide a bit of text to search for, we call this a query. Your query can include one or several terms. When you search for documents, you can use special characters to make more complex queries; see [queries](/manual/query) for more information.

## Stemming

A kind of text processing where the words in a text are stripped of all inflection. For instance, *walk*, *walks*, and *walking* are all reduced to *walk*. This can be used to ignore irrevelant variation between words. See [stemming (wikipedia)](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) for more information.

## Tag

On Textcavator, tags are labels that you can assign to documents. See [tags](/manual/tagging-documents) for more information.

## Word embeddings

Word embeddings are a way of modelling the words in a corpus. See [word embeddings](/manual/word-embeddings) for more information.
