Welcome to the I-analyzer user manual!

I-analyzer is a tool for exploring text data. The [about page](/about) provides more information about this site.

## About this manual

I-analyzer is designed to be self-explanatory whenever possible; we encourage you to explore the application and use the manual when something is unclear. You do not need to read the manual first.

As a research application, I-analyzer must not only offer useful tools to researchers, but also be accountable and transparent. Part of the function of this manual is to provide that accountability, by providing the technical description of how I-analyzer works.

This means that when, for example, you create a graph in I-analyzer and use it in a publication, you can refer to the manual for a description of the algorithm behind the graph. We try to provide explanations that are accessible for researchers from different fields. Nonetheless, these descriptions may provide more technical detail than you need to get started.

Lastly, I-analyzer includes different corpora (datasets) that do not always support the same functionality. This can depend on the available data, the size of the corpus, or the research focus of the corpus. This means that some of the functions described in this manual are not available for all corpora.
