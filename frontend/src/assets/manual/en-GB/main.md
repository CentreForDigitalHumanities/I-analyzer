Welcome to the I-analyzer user manual!

I-analyzer is a tool for exploring

## About this manual

I-analyzer is designed to be accessible, and we encourage you to explore the application and use the manual when something is unclear. You do not need to read the manual first.

As a research application, I-analyzer must not only offer useful tools to researchers, but also be accountable and transparent. Part of the function of this manual is to provide that accountability, by providing the technical description of how I-analyzer works.

This means that when, for example, you create a graph in I-analyzer and use it in a publication, you can refer to the manual for a description of the algorithm behind the graph. We try to provide explanations that are accessible for researchers from different fields. Nonetheless, these descriptions may provide more technical detail than you need to get started.
