Creating a corpus involves the following steps:

## 1. Corpus information

In this step, you provide some basic metadata about the corpus. What should it be called? What is the time period, what languages are used?

## 2. Upload source data

In this step, you upload a CSV file containing the data for your corpus. See [uploading source data](/manual/uploading_source_data) for more information.

## 3. Define fields

Based on the data file you provided in step 2, I-analyzer will generate a list of fields for the corpus. In this step, you will go through the list of fields. You can adjust the way fields are configured and add descriptions. See [types of fields](/manual/types_of_fields) for more information on different types of fields and the options they contain.

## 4. Add documentation

You can write documentation pages for your corpus. We recommend that you provide some general information about your corpus: where does the data come from? What can users expect to find?

## 5. Process data

Now that your corpus is configured, I-analyzer needs to process your data files in order to make them searchable. This means that the documents will be imported and indexed in the database.

## 6. Browse your corpus

You can browse your corpus and make sure everything works as excepted.
