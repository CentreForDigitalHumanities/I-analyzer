Creating a corpus involves the following steps:

## 1. Corpus information

In this step, you provide some basic metadata about the corpus. What should it be called? What is the time period, what languages are used?

In this step, you can also upload add documentation. We recommend that you provide some general information about your corpus: where does the data come from? What can users expect to find?

## 2. Upload source data

In this step, you upload a CSV file containing the data for your corpus. See [uploading source data](/manual/uploading_source_data) for more information.

## 3. Define fields

Based on the data file you provided in step 2, I-analyzer will generate a list of fields for the corpus. In this step, you will go through the list of fields. You can adjust the way fields are configured and add descriptions. See [types of fields](/manual/types_of_fields) for more information on different types of fields and the options they contain.

## 5. Index data

Now that your corpus is configured, I-analyzer needs to process your data files in order to make them searchable. This means that the documents will be imported and indexed in the database.

When this is done, you can start searching your corpus and make sure everything works as expected.
