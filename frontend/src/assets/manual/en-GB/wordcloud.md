The word cloud shows term frequencies of the first 1000 search results corresponding to your query. You can select which fields should be analysed for generate the wordcloud.

The wordcloud will count the frequencies of words in search results. Highly frequent words (word occuring in more than 70% of documents) are removed. In fields that offer stemming, we also use a list of common stopwords to exclude. We also remove with fewer than 3 characters, or which consist of only numbers or punctuation. After this, the frequency of the remaining words in the text field is counted.

The 50 most frequent words are ordered on the canvas, where the text size indicates the frequency of the words. The colour and orientation of the word are not meaningful.

The option "load more results" is currently under development: it does not do anything.
