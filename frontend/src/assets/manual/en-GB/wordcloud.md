The word cloud shows term frequencies of the first 1000 search results corresponding to your query. Of these search results, text fields (for instance, "Title" or "Content") are analyzed to generate the word cloud as follows:

From each text field in the current search results, stop words are removed. After this, the frequency of the remaining words in all the text fields is counted. The 50 most frequent words are then ordered on the canvas, where the text size indicates the frequency of the words. The colour and orientation of the word are not meaningful.

By clicking "Load all results", you can get the term frequencies for the full set of search results. This request may take a long time, however (indicated by the spinner on the button). If there are less than 1000 results to your query, this button is greyed out.
