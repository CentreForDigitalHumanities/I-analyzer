In some corpora, you have the option to view named entities. If this option is available, a toggle button labeled *Show named entities* is visible in the document overview, above the document content and metadata.

Activating the toggle will show entities of four types:
- Persons
- Locations
- Organizations
- Miscellaneous

### Disclaimer
Note that named entities have been extracted through machine learning using [the TextMiNER library](https://github.com/CentreForDigitalHumanities/TextMiNER). As such, the annotated entities should not be taken at face value, and only be used for exploration purposes.
