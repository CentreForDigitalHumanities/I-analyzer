In some corpora, you have the option to view named entities. Named entities are people, organisations, locations, etc. that the text refers to by name.

For example, in the following piece of text (from [Isaac Newton (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton)):

> Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree. The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton's niece, to Voltaire.

Here, "Newton", "Catherine Barton" and "Voltaire" are all named entities. But a descriptive phrase like "a tree" is not. See [named entity recognitition (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) for more information.

If this option is available, a toggle button labeled *Show named entities* is visible in the document view.

Activating the toggle will show entities of four types:
- Persons
- Locations
- Organizations
- Miscellaneous

## Disclaimer
Named entities are automatically assigned using machine learning. As such, the annotations can include mistakes, and should not be taken at face value.

If a corpus has named entity annotations, the info page for the corpus will provide more information on how the models were trained. We recommend being critical about the accuracy and possible biases of this process if you intend to use named entities in your research.
