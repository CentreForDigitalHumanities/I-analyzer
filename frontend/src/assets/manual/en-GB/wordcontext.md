Like the [related words graph](/manual/relatedwords), the word context graph shows words that appear in similar contexts to the query term. Instead of showing the similarity with the query term, the graph projects the neighbouring words onto a two-dimensional scatter plot, showing how close the terms are to each other.

Dimension reduction is performed using [TSNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding).
