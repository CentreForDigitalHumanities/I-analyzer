This graph compares the number of results by the value of a particular field, such as the date.

This visualisation counts the number of documents that match your search criteria. If you search for a term that occurs multiple times in a single documents, this is counted as a single result.

## Normalisation

You can choose whether to apply normalisation.

* Choosing **none** is the default. The graph will display the number of documents matching your search.
* You can also view the amounts as a **percentage**. In this case, each bar shows the number of documents in that bin as a percentage of the total documents in the graph.

## Zooming

You can zoom in on the x-axis by dragging the mouse. Double click on the graph to reset the zoom level.

## Comparing queries

You can compare the results of multiple queries. For example, if you searched for `bike`, you can compare it with the results for `tram`. Use the button "compare with another query" to include more queries in your graph.
