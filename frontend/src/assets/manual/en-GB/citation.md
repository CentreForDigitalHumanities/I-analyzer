## Citing documents from I-analyzer

If you want to cite a document that you accessed through I-analyzer, be sure to read the documentation of the corpus. This may include more specific information about the data and how to cite it. This page gives some general advice on citing documents from I-analyzer in your research.

### Citing a document from the I-analyzer interface

If you downloaded a document in I-analyzer, or read it online in the I-analyzer interface, your citation should make it clear that you retrieved it through here. This provides accountability: loading corpora into I-analyzer is a process that may introduce mistakes, so you should always cite the resource that you actually referenced.

For example, a citation might look something like the following:

> Doe, J. (1900). A very interesting article. *Fascinating Periodical*, *10*(2), 10-13. http://ianalyzer.hum.uu.nl/document/fascinating-corpus/12345678

The specifics will depend on the citation style you are using and the type of data in the corpus.

Documents in I-analyzer have a unique link, which looks like the one in the example above. This is the most appropriate way to reference a specific document.

Note that not all data on I-analyzer is public. For instance, some corpora are only available with an institutional login. This means that your readers may not be able to follow the link to I-analyzer.

### Citing collection of documents

For distant reading research, you may want to cite a large collection of documents, rather than a few specific ones. In this case, it is usually most appropriate to cite the corpus as a whole. This may look something like the following:

> Research Software Lab, Centre for Digital Humanities, Utrecht University (2023). *Troonredes* [data set]. http://ianalyzer.hum.uu.nl/search/troonredes

Be aware that some corpora may have other contributors. We are working on providing more specific guidelines per corpus. Feel free to contact us if you want to make sure you are referencing a corpus correctly.

### Citing a document available elsewhere

In some cases, you may have used I-analyzer to find relevant documents, and then accessed them through an external interface or archive. If so, it may be appropriate to cite that source as your reference. If you are unsure, you may consider:

- Which resource did you use as your source of truth?
- Does your citation allow readers to reference your sources? (Is is public? Will it still be available in the future?)

However, even if you cite an external source, a proper account of your research methodology should include how you selected your source material. See below how you can cite I-analyzer as a part of your methodology.

## Citing I-analyzer itself

To cite I-analyzer as a piece of software, consult our [zenodo page](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8064133). This page details how you can cite I-analyzer; it includes templates for various citation styles, and the option to export a template as a bibtex file, among others.
