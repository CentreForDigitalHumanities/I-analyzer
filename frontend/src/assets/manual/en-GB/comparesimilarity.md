This graph allows you to compare the similarity of your query term to other terms you are interested in.

This visualisation is based on word embeddings. View the [manual page on word embeddings](/manual/word-embeddings) for more information.

With this visualisation, you can view the similarity between two terms, and see how this changes over time. Similarity scores are calculated as the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## The similarity graph

You can enter one or more terms to compare your query term.

For each term, the graph will show the similarity of that term compared to your query term. For example, if you searched for _netherlands_ and enter _belgium_ and _germany_ as your comparison terms, you will see the similarity scores of _netherlands_-_belgium_ and _netherlands_-_germany_.

The graph will show how the similarity develops over time, using the model for each timeframe.

It's possible that either of the terms being compared is not included in the model of a specific time period. This is usually because it was not frequent enough. In this case, you will not see a data point for that timeframe.
