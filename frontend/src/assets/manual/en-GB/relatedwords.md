This graph shows the words which appear in the same contexts as the query term, over the whole dataset, and how similar they are to the query term within each time window. The similarity score is based on [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) of a word-document matrix, for which all word counts have been transformed with positive [pointwise mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) ([Levy, Goldberg & Dagan, 2015](https://www.transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/570)). As in [latent semantic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis), the vectors for each word in this matrix can be compared. If words appear in the same context (i.e., in the same "topics"), their vectors are more alike, which is reflected in a higher cosine similarity. To show this graph, one word matrix has been computed for the whole corpus. Prior to calculating the matrix, stop words are removed from the vocabulary. From this word-topic matrix, the five most similar words for the query term are selected (excluding the query term itself). Separate matrices were computed for consecutive time frames of one decennium (the mean of which is shown on the x-axis), and for each decennium, the similarity of the query term to the overall most similar words is computed and shown. This means that we don't necessarily get to see the words which are most similar for one specific time frame. Please also note that this visualization always represents the texts from the whole corpus (and its subsets per time frame), which means it is not affected by selections you may have applied in filters.

Currently, Related Words Query is available for the corpora "Dutch Annual Reports" and "Troonredes". Word models for other corpora will be added as soon as possible.
