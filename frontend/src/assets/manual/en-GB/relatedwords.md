This graph shows the words which appear in the same contexts as the query term across the entire corpus.

This visualisation is based on word embeddings. View the [manual page on word embeddings](/manual/word-embeddings) for more information.

With this visualisation, you can explore the terms that have the highest similarity to the search term, and see how these similarities change over time. Similarity scores are calculated as the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## The related words graph

The line graph includes the words with the highest similarity to your query term. This is the similarity across the entire corpus. The graph shows how these similarities develop over time, by showing the similarity per time frame.

Because words are selected based on their overall similarity, the line graph may not include the words that are most similar within a _specific_ timeframe.

You can select the `bar` view to view the most similar terms for each timeframe individually. In the bar view, the similar words are selected for that specific timeframe: they include the nearest neighbours in that time window, but not necessarily the nearest neighbours across the whole corpus.

### Selecting terms

If you want to select a few terms to compare, you can click terms in the legend to hide them in the graph. If you want a clean graph with just a few selected terms (without crossed-out terms in the legend), you can also use the 'compare similarity' tab of the word models page. In that graph, you can enter the specific terms you want to compare to your query term.

## Zooming

You can zoom in on the x-axis by dragging the mouse. Double click on the graph to reset the zoom level.
