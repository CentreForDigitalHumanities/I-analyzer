If you register an account on Textcavator, you can tag documents as you search.

Tags are essentially labels that you can assign to documents. You can use them as bookmarks or annotations. Feel free to create as many as you like. When you create tags, they are only visible to you; other users will not see them.

You can use the ["Your tags" page](/tags) to view and edit the tags you have created. When you open a corpus, you can use the "Your tags" filter to find documents with specific tags.
