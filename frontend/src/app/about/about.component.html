                When studying the history of a people one may learn a myriad of details from the ways in which they
                chose to remember—and consequently immortalize—their dead. These details, best summarized by the
                term “funerary culture”, are found at the heart of this initiative. Our project focuses on Jewish
                funerary culture through the ages, and particularly its epigraphical aspects: the inscriptions
                recorded on stone, plaster, or gold-glass.

            <p class="column is-12">
                Since the sources on Jewish funerary culture cover a vast temporal and spatial expanse, the only
                effective way to comprehensively analyze them is by computerized means. A great amount of the data
                is already digitized and available online, yet it is spread across various websites, whose databases
                are unrelated to one another. Consequently, scholars wishing to explore a concept or a phenomenon
                over a long period of time or across a wide geographical range, cannot. The PEACE portal will
                provide for the first time the means to do so.

                    At present, the project brings together three epigraphic databases:

                <ol class="partner">
                    <li><strong>Utrecht University: <em>Funerary Inscriptions of Jews from Italy</em></strong><em>.</em>

                </ol>
                <p class="partner-details">Over 800 Jewish epitaphs, dating to the 2nd – 11th century CE, from Rome
                    and Southern Italy.</p>

                <p class="partner-details">Over 32,000&nbsp; Jewish epitaphs, dating to the 11th – 21st century,
                    primarily from Germany.</p>

                <p class="partner-details">About 3,000 inscriptions, dating to the 6th century BCE – 7th century CE,
                    from the area of present-day Israel and Palestine. Most inscriptions are funerary, but they are not
                    restricted to the Jewish community.

            <div class="column is-8">
                <p>The three partner databases have different geographical and, partly, chronological foci, but they all
                    employ EpiDoc. This means that merging them into one large portal will be easily feasible, and also
                    that
                    future partner databases may participate by using this standard encoding format.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We hope that in future years more databases will join the project, and the PEACE portal will provide
                    an
                    encompassing picture of Jewish funerary culture.
