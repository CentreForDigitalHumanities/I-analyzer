            This visualisation is based on a sample of the documents in your search results.
            These approximations are usually sufficient for exploring the corpus.

        <p>
            However, we also offer the option to request the data
            based on <i>all</i> the documents in your search results.
            When your results are ready, you will be able to download
            the data as a csv file.
        </p>

        <p>
            The results may take a long time to compute.
            If you confirm that you want the full data,
            our server will start to compute it for you,
            and you will receive an email when your file is complete.
            The email will include a link to download the data.
            You do not need to keep this window open.
