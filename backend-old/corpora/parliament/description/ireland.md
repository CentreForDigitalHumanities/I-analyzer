The debates of the Irish houses of parliament (Oireachtas) from 1919-2020. Debates up to 2013 are from the Dáil, debates from 2014 are from the Dáil and Seanad.

### Language

Debates are in English or Irish.

### Metadata

The data up to 2013 and from 2014 onwards were extracted from different source data. This means that some metadata fields are only available up to 2013, or only from 2014. Specifically:

- The fields _party_, _party ID_, and _speaker constituency_ are only available from 1919-2013.
- The fields _parliamentary role_, _debate type_, _committee_ and _url_ are only available from 2014-2020.
- Ministerial roles are available from 1937-2011 and 2014-2020.

The separate source data also mean that the unique IDs for speakers are not consolidated. If a speaker appeared both before and since 2014, they will have one ID for speeches up to 2013, and one ID for speeches from 2014.

A more unified dataset is available at [api.oireachtas.ie](https://api.oireachtas.ie/).
