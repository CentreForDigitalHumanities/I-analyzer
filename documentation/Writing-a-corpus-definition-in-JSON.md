# Writing a corpus definition in JSON

Database-only corpora support a JSON format for creating or editing corpus definitions. Like Python definitions, a JSON definition can be used to store and share a configuration for a corpus.

The format is defined in [corpus.schema.json](/backend/addcorpus/schemas/corpus.schema.json). You can find an example in the [test JSON definition](../backend/corpora_test/basic/mock_corpus.json).

We do not (currently) have a guide to writing JSON definitions, though the JSON schema includes descriptions for each field.

## Importing and exporting definitions

You can import and export JSON definitions through the frontend. Visit `/corpus-definitions/` to do so.

Some notes on importing and exporting JSON definitions:

- A JSON definition is less detailed than the database model. This is because the database model must also support Python corpora (which offer more customisation) and legacy options. If you edit a corpus through the admin, exporting it to JSON and importing it again may include some normalisation.
- Some properties of the corpus are not handled through the JSON interface, though they are supported in database-only corpora. Currently, these can only be configured in the admin. These are the corpus image, documentation pages, and data directory. You an edit these properties in the admin site once you have uploaded the JSON definition.
