  Textcavator is a tool for exploring corpora (large
  collections of texts). You can use Textcavator to find
  relevant documents, or to make visualisations to
  understand broader trends in the corpus. The interface is
  designed to be accessible for users of all skill levels.

  Textcavator is primarily intended for academic research and
  higher education. We focus on data that is relevant for
  the humanities, but we are open to datasets that are
  relevant for other fields.
