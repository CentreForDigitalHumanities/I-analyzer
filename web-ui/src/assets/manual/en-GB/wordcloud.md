The word cloud currently takes all the results that are visible in the Search Results tab. This means that after the first search, 20 search results will be used, and more results will be used if you clicked "Load more". Of these search results, text fields (for instance, "Title" or "Content") are analyzed to generate the word cloud as follows:

From each text field in the current search results, stop words are removed. After this, the frequency of the remaining words in all the text fields is counted. The 50 most frequent words are then ordered on the canvas, where the text size indicates the frequency of the words. The colour and orientation of the word are not meaningful.

In time, there will be word clouds for *all* search results. As generating a word cloud for thousands of results will lead to long waiting times, we are currently investigating the best way to facilitate this.
